- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wild-Childs-WannabeeTuner
- 👀 I’m interested in ...Learning EVERYTHING on Custom Tuning (Be it Any & All Types Electronic/Engine Computer Modules aka ECU/PCM and any other type circuitboards that are able to be programmed and that i can explore through and optimise for what works for myself and not just be told what it is that i am allowed and not allowed (Figuratively Speaking -To a point lol)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... (Setting my system up after following deeply along to owner of saildot4k and hes site MSS54 github repository & what a champion and mentor!! Loved and Loving all his work he has done thus far and continue to do - Massive Thank You Mate all the way down in Australia!! I continue replaying your tutorials and learning from your dedicated hardwork Student For Life of saildot4k that said though, i am a qualified  Heavy Vehicle Diesel Mechanic and have been in that industry for 16-17 years and am looking for something more indepth and can continue those "OHH FaRkU!!" Moments hahaha  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... All of the Software tuning nad elctronics diagnostics and Performance Tuning with my laptop and the OBD port on Light Vehicles and Even other Interfaces for small motors and then via the J1939 data link or J-Link (incase i got the J1939 Incorrect as it has been a while but that would be for heavy Vehicles etc) and also looking at other types of platforms to use and look into learning that may help with the vehicles or other electronic PCB's i am trying to exploit and programme to get the most out of them and basically just dive deep into exploring shit lol. I am ADHD and hav been diagnosed since the age of 3 so i can get deeply sidetracked and probably best to not hold me to any type of timeframes because it is mostly all last minute rip into it and get it done moments however i seem to always pull off what it is that interests me, but that said though, if it is of no interest to my brain within the first few minutes (sometimes seconds) then im stuffed and ill zone out and that will be the last of it to EVER CROSS MY THOUGHTS lol. I have about 30 - 40 hobbies at once with this head of mine and i am usually found in deep thought with myself and within the brain i have atleast 10 to 15 Different levels of converstaion going on with my brain and saying that i am just really trying to say to you all that i can get a little lost in my own thoughts at times as i am definately a very deep thinker on Multiple Levels!
